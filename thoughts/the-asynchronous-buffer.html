<p>Over the past few months tinkering with generative AI, I’ve realized that I’ve become a lot more impatient for information. Generation time is so long (especially in “thinking” mode) and others around me experience the same feeling of impatience when waiting for an answer in the chat. </p>

<p>One mechanism of getting around this problem is to use a UI with no status-reporting. For example, SMS messaging interfaces which make it seem like you are messaging a friend, such that it is expected that you wait some time for a text back. That seems like an intuitive, async buffer.</p>

<p>Another familiar interaction surface is the e-mail inbox. You send an information-dense packet to a colleague, and it is expected that they take some time to process it before replying. </p>

<p>What are some other interesting modes of async communication?</p></div>
