At that juncture, machines will operate autonomously from humans. At first they will perform the same tasks more efficiently; eventually they will define and pursue their own objectives. Once that threshold is crossed, man and machine will no longer share the same economic sphere. For humans, value will be anchored in biologyâ€”food, sex, sleep, and health. For machines, value will be anchored in energy and data."],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
