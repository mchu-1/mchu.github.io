Generation time is so long (especially in \"thinking\" mode) and others around me experience the same feeling of impatience when waiting for an answer in the chat. \n\nOne mechanism of getting around this problem is to use a UI with no status-reporting. For example, SMS messaging interfaces which make it seem like you are messaging a friend, such that it is expected that you wait some time for a text back. That seems like an intuitive, async buffer.\n\nAnother familiar interaction surface is the e-mail inbox. You send an information-dense packet to a colleague, and it is expected that they take some time to process it before replying. \n\nWhat are some other interesting modes of async communication?"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
