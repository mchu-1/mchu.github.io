<p>“Is it ethical to engineer human embryos for enhancement?”</p>

<p>Yes, because it gives parents a way to give a better life to their children through a deterministic means. Does this violate consent, especially since the patient cannot decide whether they want to be given certain traits before birth? Yes, but being born with the traits you are given by your parents is not always the traits that you wish for. Perhaps being faster, stronger, prettier or smarter than nature would allow is a more universal desire than it seems. Does it widen the socio-economic gap between people? Yes, but socio-economic gaps are the inevitable result of human desire. In the end, a moratorium on this technology will only push it (like many other things throughout the history of medicine, such as organ transplants) into an unregulated market. It needs to be introduced to society with the economic and social systems we have, so that people can have access to it in regulated medical systems.</p></div>
