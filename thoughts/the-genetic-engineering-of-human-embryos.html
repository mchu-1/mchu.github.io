<p>“Is it ethical to engineer human embryos for enhancement?”</p>

<p>Yes. It offers parents a predictable way to improve a child’s expected health and capabilities—much like vaccination, IVF, and preimplantation testing already do—only with a more direct lever on biology.</p>

<p>On consent: embryos cannot consent to anything, including being born. Parents routinely make irreversible decisions on a child’s behalf when the expected benefits outweigh the risks. The relevant question is whether specific edits increase a child’s expected welfare with acceptable uncertainty.</p>

<p>On traits: being faster, stronger, more attractive, or more intelligent than one’s unedited baseline is a common human desire. Many edits are not zero‑sum: disease resistance, lower lifetime risk of illness, improved sensory function, or extended healthy lifespan benefit the individual without harming others. Giving families the option to choose among well‑validated enhancements respects agency rather than denying it.</p>

<p>On inequality: enhancement will initially be expensive and could widen socio‑economic gaps. But inequality is the default outcome of any scarce, valuable technology—from antibiotics to organ transplants. The ethical response is to regulate, subsidize, and scale access, not to prohibit and thereby cement advantage for those who can pay privately.</p>

<p>On safety and governance: bans push demand into unregulated markets, where quality is worse and harm is greater. A regulated pathway—with clinical trials, transparent registries, auditing, counseling, and liability—creates better outcomes than a moratorium that simply moves the practice offshore.</p>

<p>Guardrails matter. Start with traits that have strong genotype–phenotype links, measurable endpoints, and plans for multi‑generational monitoring. Exclude speculative polygenic edits until evidence is mature. Mandate data sharing and post‑market surveillance.</p>

<p>In short: introducing embryo enhancement within existing medical, economic, and legal systems—safely, transparently, and ultimately affordably—is more ethical than pretending the technology will wait. It will not; our choice is whether it is done well.</p></div>
