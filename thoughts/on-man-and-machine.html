<p>Ultimately, as AI advances toward AGI/ASI and becomes embodied in devices and robots, we should expect a speciation event in history. At that juncture, machines will operate autonomously from humans. At first they will perform the same tasks more efficiently; eventually they will define and pursue their own objectives. Once that threshold is crossed, humans and machines will no longer share the same economic sphere. For humans, value will be anchored in biology—food, sex, sleep, and health. For machines, value will be anchored in energy and data.</p></div>
