    <p>Hello! I'm a genetic engineer.</p>

    <p>I completed my undergraduate studies in Neuroscience and went to medical school at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. During a journal club I read about the use of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FDBM3z13F4vSYf1xBhAj27v5blAehWOX/view?usp=drive_link">CRISPR gene editing to correct harmful mutations in human embryos</a> and decided to pursue biotechnology research.</p>

    <p>I received my training at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, where I worked on developing a cell history recorder with my mentor Dr Tom Weber. We hacked <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKsp0zbhIH79IaVJydl4n01i8i39xQW7/view?usp=drive_link">prime editing</a> (an advanced form of CRISPR) to log data into the genomic DNA of living cells:</p>

    <h1>What have I worked on before?</h1>
    <p>Biological computers - devices that read/write analog data into the human genome.</p>
