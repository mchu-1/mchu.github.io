    <p>As biotechnology advances, there is a need for a central digital repository of DNA.</p>
    <p>At the moment, we are still operating under the assumption that agar stabs of plasmids (Addgene) are the best way to share DNA. However, as DNA synthesis and cloning costs fall, there will be an increasing preference towards synthesizing DNA from scratch and ordering it in fresh, lyophilized and sequence-verified form.</p>
    <p>DNA - the 'source code'  of biotechnology - is inherently fungible. Much like software, it can be copied at will. As the cost and accessibility of sequencing falls (Plasmidsaurus), it will only take 10-20 ng of DNA from any given sample to determine its sequence. This means that the barriers to innovation through reading and writing other people's DNA designs are virtually non-existent. Furthermore, since it is impossible to trace individual sequences of DNA once they are combined with other sequences into new arrangements, it is too hard to have a possessive regulatory system (patents) to prevent the re-use of DNA designs. We should be using the fungibility of DNA - the fact that it can be synthesized and sequenced at will - to accelerate innovation.</p>
    <p>We propose to build the world's first searchable digital platform for DNA designs, which will be tightly integrated with online publication channels. The platform will be different from existing DNA editors (Benchling, Snapgene) in that it will be read-only. Creators publishing new work online will be able to log their DNA constructs into the platform, which will scan the sequence, annotate features, and generate a visible link that can be included on the side tab in the publication website (e.g. bioRxiv). Any updates to the constructs can be submitted as new versions through the creator's account.</p>
    <p>Users of the platform will be able to instantly access DNA constructs associated with publications of interest through the embedded link on the publication journal. Since the final annotation of all constructs will be performed by the platform itself (merging any creator annotations with our own feature database), it will be a trustless way to validate and share DNA designs. Users can also follow a creator or a design and be automatically updated on new versions of their constructs.</p>
    <p>This platform - which we call Oasis - will be a self-updating and largely automated Internet repository in the long run. We propose its core features to be (1) the largest evolving database of DNA features (powered by web crawlers) (2) the most robust and fastest DNA annotation software on the Internet (including bio-security features), and (3) the most usable search and versioning platform for DNA constructs online.</p>
